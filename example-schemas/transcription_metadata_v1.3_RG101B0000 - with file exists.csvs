//Schema updates: brackets, hyphen in street name, extend house number to allow eg 112-111, question marks in house number
//for continuations - by definition schedule/subsched should already have appeared.
/*Updates following meeting 24/7. Allow for non-numeric schedule refs where duplicates are distinguished in original by addition of a-f or A-F as a suffix, 
or where we have had to distinguish duplicates ourselves which will add suffix of form DUPnn (if the value is an integer the previous range will still be checked.)
Allow additional punctuation in street_name - instructions should already be OK as the length check should allow any string characters */
/*For general understanding of the data, a piece is an individual booklet of registration data (these were usually bound into a volume after the register was completed), compiled by an 
enumerator from the household returns for a specific area. An item is an individual page from the registers, this may be a cover page (ITEM_TITLEPAGE) which contains various summary 
information about the area covered, or a register page (ITEM_MAINPAGE or ITEM_CONPAGE) which has header info relating to the place, then around 40 or so lines filled to some degree with 
individual rows of data about each person in a household (or a brief entry for vacant houses and similar) these are the various SUBITEM types*/
