      This document represents the specification of the CSV Schema Language 1.2
      as defined by <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk">The National Archives</a>.
      It is unclear yet whether this document will be submitted to a formal standards body
      such as the <a href="http://w3.org">W3C</a>.  
	  This version will supersede <a href="http://digital-preservation.github.io/csv-schema/csv-schema-1.1.html">CSV Schema Language 1.1</a> published on 25 January 2016,

      <acronym title="Comma Separated Value">CSV</acronym> (Comma Separated Value) data comes in many shapes and sizes. Apart from [[RFC4180]] which is a fairly recent development (and often ignored),
      there is a lack of formal definition as to CSV data formats, although in many ways this is one of the strengths of the CSV data format.
      However, extracting structured information from CSV data for further processing or storage
      can prove difficult if the CSV data is not well understood or perhaps not even uniform. CSV Schema
      defines a textual language which can be used to define the data structure, types and rules for
      CSV data formats.

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The intention of this document is two-fold:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To be informative to users who are writing CSV Schemas, and provide a reference to the available syntax and functions.</li>
            <li>To provide enough detail such that anyone with sufficient technical expertise should be able to implement a CSV Schema parser and/or CSV validator evaluating the rules defined in a CSV Schema.</li>
        </ol>
        <section id="background">
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
            	The National Archives <acronym title="Digital Repository Infrastructure">DRI</acronym> (Digital Repository Infrastructure) system archives digitised and born-digital materials provided by <acronym title="Other Governmental Department">OGD</acronym>s (Other Government Departments)
                and occasionally <acronym title="Non Governmental Organisation">NGO</acronym>s (Non-Governmental Organisations). For the purposes of Digital Preservation the system processes and archives large amounts of metadata, much
                of this metadata is created by the supplying organisation or by transcription. The metadata is further processed, and ultimately stored both online in an
                <acronym title="Resource Description Format">RDF</acronym> Triplestore and a majority subset archived in a non-RDF <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> format.
                However it was recognised that the creation of XML or RDF metadata by the supplier
                was most likely unrealistic for either technical or financial reasons. As such, CSV was recognised as a simple data format that is human readable (to a degree), that almost anyone could create
                simply; CSV is the <em>lowest common denominator</em> of structured data formats.
            </p>
            <p>
                The National Archives have strict rules about various CSV file formats that they expect, and how the data in those file formats should be set out. To ensure the quality of their archival metadata
                it was recognised that CSV files would have to be validated. It was recognised that development of a schema language for CSV (and associated tools) would be of great benefit. It was
                also further recognised that a general CSV Schema language would be of greater benefit if it was made publicly available and invited collaboration from other organisations and
                individuals; the problem of CSV data formats is certainly not unique to The National Archives.
            </p>
        	<p>CSV Schema is a standard currently guided by The National Archives, but developed in an open source collaborative manner that invites collaboration and contributions from all interested parties.</p>
        	<p>A reference implementation has been created to prove the standard: The open source <a href="http://digital-preservation.github.io/csv-validator/">CSV Validator</a> application and API, offers both CSV Schema parsing and CSV file validation.</p>

        <section id="principles">
            <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
            <p>The design of the CSV Schema language has been influenced by a few guiding principles, understanding these will help you to understand how and why it is structured the way that it is.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <div class="principle">Simplicity</div>
                    <p>The language should be expressible in plain text and should be simple enough that non-technical domain experts could easily write it without having to know a programming language or data/document modelling language such as XML, JSON or RDF.</p>
                    <p><strong>Note</strong>, the CSV Schema Language is NOT itself expressed in CSV, it is expressed in a simple text format.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="principle">Context is King!</div>
                    <p>A schema rule is written for each column of the CSV file. Each set of column rules are asserted against each row of the CSV file. Each rule in the CSV Schema operates on the current context (e.g. defined Column and parsed Row), unless otherwise specified. This makes the rules short and concise.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="principle">Stream Processing</div>
                    <p>CSV files may be very large and so the CSV Schema Language was designed with concern for implementations, that although not required by the specification, MAY wish to read and process CSV data as a stream. Few operations require mnenomization of data from the CSV file, and where they do this is limited and should be optimisable to keep memory use to a minimum.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="principle">Sane Defaults</div>
                    <p>We try to do the right thing by default. CSV files and their brethren (Tab Separated Values etc.) can come in many shapes and sizes, by default we assume the CSV data format will comply with [[RFC4180]], of course we allow you to customize this behaviour in the CSV Schema.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="principle">Not a Programming Language.</div>
                    <p>This is worth stressing as it was something we had to keep sight of ourselves during development; CSV Schema is a simple data definition and validation language for CSV!</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
    </section>
    <section id="basics" class="informative">
        <h1>Basics</h1>
        <p>
            A CSV Schema is really a rules based language which defines how data in each cell should be formatted.
            Rules are expressed per-column of the CSV data. Rules are evaluated for each row in the CSV data.
            A column rule may express constraints based on the content of other columns in the same row, however at present there is no scope for looking forward or backward through rows directly.
			However, it is possible to check that a cell entry is unique within that column in the CSV file (or that the value of a combination of cells is unique)
        </p>
        <p>A CSV Schema is made up of two main parts:</p>
		<ol class="nested">
			<li class="nested"><span class="point"><a>Prolog</a></span>
			<p>In turn this comprises (at most) two sections (the second being OPTIONAL):</p>
			<ol class="nested">
				<li class="nested">
					<span class="point"><a>Version Declaration</a></span>
					<p>The CSV Schema MUST explicitly state (as its first non-comment line) the version of the CSV Schema language that it uses. This is to allow for future evolution of the CSV Schema language to be easily handled by CSV Schema processors.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="nested">
					<span class="point"><a>Global Directives</a></span>
					<p>Global Directives apply to all processing of the CSV data. Global Directives for example allow you to define the separator sequence between columns in the CSV data. Global Directives appear before Column Rules and are prefixed with an <code>@</code> character.</p>
					<p>The use of Global Directives is OPTIONAL, default values are used if they are not specified.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li class="nested">
				<span class="point"><a>Body</a></span>
				<p>The Body of the CSV Schema MUST declare, in order, a <a title="Column Rules">Column Rule</a> for each Column in the CSV data. If validation of a Column is not desirable, then an empty rule is used.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
        <p>Let's now illustrate a simple CSV Schema that is concerned with CSV data about names, ages and gender:</p>
        <pre class="example" data-lt="Simple CSV Schema">
version 1.2
@totalColumns 3
name: notEmpty
age: range(0, 120)
gender: is("m") or is("f") or is("t") or is("n") 
            </pre>
            This CSV Schema basically defines that the CSV data must have 3 columns: the first
            column, <em>name</em>, must have some sort of value; the second column, <em>age</em>,
            must be a number between 0 and 120 inclusive; and the third column, <em>gender</em>,
            must be one of the characters m, f, t or n. An example of CSV data that would match the
            rule definitions in the CSV schema could be as follows:
            <pre class="example" data-lt="Valid CSV Data">
name,age,gender
james,21,m
lauren,19,f
simon,57,m
        </pre>
    	<p>An example of CSV data would fail the rule definitions in the CSV schema could be as follows:</p>
        <pre class="example" data-lt="Invalid CSV Data">
name,age,gender
james,4 years,m
lauren,19,f
simon,57,male
        </pre>
        <p>The Invalid CSV Data example above fails when validated against the CSV Schema because: 1) at row 2 column 2, "4 years" is not a number between 1 and 120 inclusive, and 2) at row 4 column 3, "male" is not one of the characters m, f, t, or n.</p>

			<h1>New in CSV Schema Language 1.2 - A brief introduction to the new features of CSV Schema Language 1.2</h1>
			<p>
			CSV Schema Language 1.2 further extends the String Provider concept with a URI Decode Expression which converts the percentage-encoding used within URIs back to a normal
			string (eg converting %20 to a space). This takes 1 or 2 inputs, the first is the string to be decoded (as a String Provider), 
			and the second is an OPTIONAL instruction to use a particular character set.
			By default the decoding will use UTF-8.

		expressed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBNF"><dfn title="EBNF">Extended Backhaus-Naur Form</dfn></a>  (EBNF - see also [[RFC5234]])
		</p>
		<p>
		The following subsections examine the structure of a CSV Schema in more detail. 
		Each subsection comprises definitions of terms, cross-references to other definitions, 
		the relevant portion of the <a>EBNF</a> (links on the lefthandside go to the appendix containing the full EBNF, those on the right to a fuller explanation of those term(s)), 
		and examples of correct usage.
		</p>

		A <dfn>Schema</dfn> MUST comprise both <a>Prolog</a> and <a>Body</a>.

			</tr>

		<section>
			<h2>Prolog</h2>
			<p>The <dfn>Prolog</dfn> of a CSV Schema MUST contain the <a>Version Declaration</a> and MAY contain one or more <a>Global Directives</a>.</p>

				<h3>Version Declaration</h3>
				<p>
				The <dfn>Version Declaration</dfn> declares explicitly which version of the CSV Schema language is in use. 
				This MUST be either <code>version 1.0</code>, <code>version 1.1</code>, or <code>version 1.2</code>. 
				If the version is not valid this is considered a <a>Schema Error</a>. 
				If the version is declared as 1.0 but the CSV Schema attempts to use features of 1.1 or 1.2 (or declared as 1.1 and uses features of 1.2) 
				this is also considered a <a>Schema Error</a>.
				The Version Declaration is MANDATORY.

				<h3>Global Directives</h3>
				<p>
				The <dfn>Global Directives</dfn> allow you to modify the overall processing of a CSV file or how subsequent <a title="Column Definition">Column Definitions</a> are evaluated. 
				The use of Global Directives within a CSV Schema is OPTIONAL.
				The last two Global Directives described (<a>No Header Directive</a> and <a>Ignore Column Name Case Directive</a>) are mutually exclusive, 
				they MUST NOT both be used in a single schema. 
				There is no inherent reason why the Global Directives should be in the order shown, <a>EBNF</a> does not directly cater for unordered lists.
				You could explicitly list each possible ordering, but that would require 4!=24 orderings to be included in the ENBF.
				All directives (both Global Directives and <a>Column Directives</a>) used in the CSV Schema are indicated by the <dfn>Directive Prefix</dfn>, 
				defined as the character <code>@</code> i.e. the [[UTF-8]] character code <code>0x40</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
				Whitespace is not generally significant, so Global Directives can be entered all on a single line, or each on separate lines 
				(see <a href="#example-global-directives"></a>).

					<h4>Separator Directive</h4>
					<p>The <dfn>Separator Directive</dfn> allows you to specify the separator character that is used between columns in the CSV data. 
					As with all <a>Global Directives</a> the Separator Directive is OPTIONAL, if not supplied the default value is assumed.
					By default the separator is a <code>comma (,)</code> i.e. the [[UTF-8]] character code <code>0x2c</code> (as specified in [[RFC4180]]).
					</p>
					<p>
					The Separator Directive takes a MANDATORY parameter in the form of either a <a>Separator Tab Expression</a> or a <a>Separator Character</a>.
					</p>
					<p>A <dfn>Separator Tab Expression</dfn> indicates that the separator comprises a <emphasis>tab</emphasis> character, i.e. [[UTF-8]] character code <code>0x09</code>.</p>
					<p>A <dfn>Separator Character</dfn> is a <a>Character Literal</a>: the character which is to be treated as the column separator.</p>

					<h4>Quoted Directive</h4>
					<p>The <dfn>Quoted Directive</dfn> allows you to specify whether or not all columns are <em>quoted</em>. 
					That is to say that their values are encased in <em>quotation mark</em> characters, i.e. [[UTF-8]] character code <code>0x22</code>.
					In practice most CSV libraries are able to detect and handle the presence or absence of quotes and handle it appropriately, 
					but implementations of this schema language should be able to decide how to handle this situation.

					<h4>Total Columns Directive</h4>
					<p>
					The <dfn>Total Columns Directive</dfn> allows you to specify the total number of data columns expected to make up each row of the CSV file.
					The parser will also verify that the <a>Body</a> of the CSV Schema contains the same number of <a>Column Rules</a>,
					a mismatch is considered a <a>Schema Error</a>.
					The Total Columns Directive is OPTIONAL: when this directive is not used this verification of the number of Column Rules cannot be performed,

					The Permit Empty Directive is OPTIONAL: when not present an empty file will cause a validation error.
					The Permit Empty Directive can be used in conjunction with the <a>No Header Directive</a> thereby permitting a completely empty CSV file. 
					If the <a>No Header Directive</a> is not present then a minimum of one row containing column names must be provided.

					<p>
					The <dfn>No Header Directive</dfn> is used to indicate that the CSV file to be validated does not contain a header row: i.e. all rows are data rows.
					The No Header Directive is OPTIONAL: when this directive is not used the parser assumes by default that the first row of the CSV file to be validated contains column names,
					not data, and so the first row is skipped during validation.

							<h6>Optional Directive</h6>
							<p>
							The <dfn>Optional Directive</dfn> is used when completion of the data field in the original CSV file to be validated is OPTIONAL. 
							When this directive is used the data in the column is considered valid if the <a title="Column Rules">Column Rule</a> evaluates to true, or if the column is empty.

						<section>
							<h6>Match Is False Directive</h6>
							<p>
							The <dfn>Match Is False Directive</dfn> is used to flip the result of a test from negative to positive (or vice-versa).
							It may be very simple to write a condition which matches the data considered to be invalid, while the equivalent for valid data would be very convoluted.

						<section>
							<h6>Ignore Case Directive</h6>
							<p>
							The <dfn>Ignore Case Directive</dfn> is used when the case of a column value is not important.

						<section>
							<h6>Warning Directive</h6>
							<p>
							The <dfn>Warning Directive</dfn> is used to convert a <a>Validation Error</a> into a <a>Validation Warning</a>.  
							This is useful if you wish to be alerted to a data condition which is unusual, but not necessarily invalid.
							For instance, at The National Archives we have come across archival material where the clerk who originally completed a form 
							wrote down an "impossible" date such as 30 February or 31 April. We have to do our best to accept the data as originally supplied 
							(we have no idea if it is the day or month of the date which is actually incorrect), but we also wish to ensure that additional 
							Quality Assurance checking is performed to ensure this is not a transcription error. Warnings are listed in the validation report, 
							but the data file MAY still considered valid if only warnings are present.

					<h4>Column Definitions examples</h4>
					<pre class="example" data-lt="Column Definition Syntax">
	a_column_title:			is("somedata") or is("otherdata")        	@optional @matchIsFalse @ignoreCase @warning
	another_column_title:		isNot("somedata") and isNot("otherdata")	@ignoreCase
					</pre>
					<p>
					The two Column Definitions are both validating the data in their respective columns against the explicit strings <code>somedata</code> and <code>otherdata</code>.
					Ignoring the <a>Column Directives</a> for the moment, the column rule defined for <code>a_column_title</code> would return true if the CSV data for that column 
					contained either the precise string <code>somedata</code> or <code>otherdata</code>.  However, the <a>Optional Directive</a> means a completely empty column 
					would also be acceptable. Also, since the <a>Ignore Case Directive</a> is also applied, the strings <code>SomeData</code> or <code>OTHERDATA</code> (for example) 
					would also be acceptable.  But, since the <a>Match Is False Directive</a> is in effect, the validation is inverted, it would actually be any string <em>other</em> 
					than the two specified which would be regarded as acceptable data.  Since the <a>Warning Directive</a> is also used, a validation failure would not be considered 
					an error though.
					</p>
					<p>
					The second Column Definition (with the effect of the <a>Match Is False Directive</a> on the first taken into account) is actually logically equivalent to the first 
					(see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws">De Morgan's Laws</a>).  However, since the <a>Optional Directive</a> has not been used, an empty column 
					would not be valid data, and since the <a>Warning Directive</a> has also not been included, a <a>Validation Warning</a> would be raised instead of a <a>Validation Error</a>.

		<h1>Column Validation Expressions</h1>
		<p>
		The key building blocks for <a>Column Rules</a> are <dfn title="Column Validation Expression">Column Validation Expressions</dfn>.  
		These are divided into two main classes, <a title="Non Conditional Expression">Non Conditional Expressions</a> and <a title="Conditional Expression">Conditional Expressions</a>.
		Non Conditional Expressions boil down to checks resulting in a pass or fail (a number of expressions may be combined to produce an overall validation check), Conditional Expressions allow for more subtle checks, 
		if for example you are validating a <code>title</code> column which allows the values <code>Mr</code>, <code>Mrs</code>, <code>Ms</code>, <code>Miss</code> and <code>Dr</code>, 
		You could construct a Conditional Expression which also checks the <code>sex</code> column and if that contains <code>female</code>, 
		then <code>Mr</code> would be regarded as invalid (strictly speaking that would also require the use of an <a>Explicit Context Expression</a> to refer to the other column, 
		but that is a subexpression of the Non Conditional Expression class).
		</p>
    	<p><strong>NOTE</strong> To increase control over expression applicability and to avoid creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_recursion">left-recursive</a> grammar (which could lead to problems for various parser implementations),
    	<a title="Column Validation Expression">Column Validation Expressions</a> have been further split into <a title="Combinatorial Expression">Combinatorial Expressions</a> and <a title="Non Combinatorial Expression">Non Combinatorial Expressions</a>.</p>

						<h4>Range Expressions</h4>
						<p>
						<em>The definition of this expression from CSV Schema Language 1.1 on extends the definition originally made in CSV Schema Language 1.0</em>
						</p>
						<p>
						A <dfn>Range Expression</dfn> checks that the value of the column is a number lying between, or equal to, the supplied upper and lower bounds.  
						One or other bounding value MAY be left unrestricted (by using the <a>Wildcard Literal</a>), 
						so that the expression can also be used to check that a column is at least some value, or at most some value. 
						One bounding value is defined as a <dfn>Numeric Or Any</dfn> expression which accepts a <a>Numeric Literal</a> (a Real Number expressed as a decimal), 
						or the <a>Wildcard Literal</a>, while the other is a <a>Numeric Literal</a> only. 
						Therefore at least one of the bounding values MUST be a <a>Numeric Literal</a> rather than a <a>Wildcard Literal</a>, 
						so valid Range Expressions SHALL define ranges of:
						<ol>
							<li>At least <em>n</em>. For example <code>range(10, *)</code> states that the column value MUST be <em>at least</em> 10</li>
							<li>At most <em>n</em>. For example <code>range(*, 10)</code> ensures that the column value MUST be <em>at most</em> 10 (and may be negative).</li>
							<li>Between <em>m</em> and <em>n</em>(inclusive). For example <code>range(4, 7)</code> ensures that the column value MUST be <em>between</em> 4 and 7 (inclusive).</li>

						<h4>Length Expressions</h4>
						<p>A <dfn>Length Expression</dfn> checks that the number of characters in the column meets the supplied definition.  You can define the length in one of four ways:</p>						
						<ol>
							<li>Precisely <em>n</em> characters long. For example <code>length(10)</code> ensures that the length is <em>exactly</em> 10 characters.</li>
							<li>At least <em>n</em> characters long. For example <code>length(10, *)</code> ensures that the length is <em>at least</em> 10 or more characters</li>
							<li>At most <em>n</em> characters long. For example <code>length(*, 10)</code> ensures that the length is <em>at most</em> 10 characters.</li>
							<li>Between <em>m</em> and <em>n</em> characters long (inclusive). For example <code>length(4, 7)</code> ensures that the length is at least 4 characters and at most 7 characters.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							In order to do this the expression takes two input parameters, the first is defined as OPTIONAL, the second MUST be supplied.  Both take the form of a 
							<dfn>Positive Integer Or Any</dfn> expression, which is either a <a>Positive Integer Literal</a> (which actually includes zero), or a <a>Wildcard Literal</a>.

						<h4>Integrity Check Expressions</h4>
						<p>
						<em>This expression was introduced in CSV Schema Language 1.1</em>
						</p>
						<p>
						An <dfn>Integrity Check Expression</dfn> checks a filesystem to see if there are any files present that are not specifically mentioned in the CSV file.
						It takes three expressions as parameters.
						The first are two OPTIONAL expressions in the form of <a title="String Provider">String Providers</a>. 
						The first (as in the <a>File Exists Expression</a>) allows you to supply a string (or reference to a string) 
						with a full filepath to prepend to the contents of the current column (in the case that for example it only contains just the name of the file).
						The default value for this string is an empty string.
						The second parameter allows a string provider to be given to point to an explicit subdirectory relative to the location of the base path.
						By default this subdirectory is expected to be called "content".
						If only a single OPTIONAL parameter is supplied, it will be assumed to be the first, so if you wish to set only the second OPTIONAL parameter,
						you MUST also explicitly supply the first as an empty string ("")
						The final expression MUST be supplied.  This indicates whether references to subfolders are explicitly included in the CSV file, 
						if the CSV file has a row for each subfolder the exact string "includeFolder" should be given, 
						if the subfolders do not have explicit references, the exact string "excludeFolder" should be given.
						</p>
						<p>
						Default treatment of case sensitivity should follow the norms of the relevant file system, 
						implementations may wish to include some means to over-ride this, but that is outside the scope of the EBNF.

						<h4>Checksum Expressions</h4>

						and a checksum algorithm.  File location is given in the form of a <a>File Expression</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
						The EBNF does not specify valid values for the <a>String Literal</a> representing the checksum algorithm, that is instead implementation defined, however
						it is strongly recommended that implementations SHOULD at least support: <code>MD5</code>, <code>SHA-1</code> and <code>SHA-256</code>. It is important to note that the checksum value MUST

					A string that does not contain a <code>full stop (.)</code>, i.e. the [[UTF-8]] character codes <code>0x2D</code> will be returned unchanged.
					</p>
					<p>
					<em>This is a new expression in CSV Schema Language 1.2</em>
					</p>
					<p>
					The <dfn>URI Decode Function</dfn> takes two <a title="String Provider">String Providers</a> as arguments.  
					The first argument MUST be supplied and provides the string that is to be decoded.  Decoding is in the sense described in [[!RFC3986]], Section 2, Characters, 
					converting characters represented by a percent-encoding back to their usual character representation, <code>%20</code> is decoded to a <code>space ( )</code>.
					By default it is assumed that the original percent-encoding is based on UTF-8, but this can be overriden with the OPTIONAL second parameter which supplies 
					another string representing the alternative character set to be used.
					</p>
					<p>
					This function is intended to facilitate comparison between data in two or more columns where one column is in the form of a URI (and would normally be validated by
					a <a>URI Expression</a>) and the others are simple string data.

				This is particularly useful when the data expected in one column depends on the value of another column.

				CSV Schema Language 1.1 introduced the <a>Switch Expression</a> which allows a more compact and readable form for what would

					<h3>Switch Expressions</h3>
					<p>
					<em>This expression was introduced in CSV Schema Language 1.1</em>
					</p>
					<p>
					The <dfn>Switch Expression</dfn> generalises the <a>If Expression</a>. It comprises at least one <a>Switch Case Expression</a> followed by a final OPTIONAL parameter,

		<h1>Errors and Warnings</h1>
		<p>
		An implementation MUST first check that the provided CSV Schema(s) are syntactically correct. If not, a <a>Schema Error</a> is produced, 
		and no further validation of the CSV Schema(s) or provided CSV files(s) SHOULD be undertaken. If the schema check is successful then an implementation
		MAY continue with further CSV Schema(s) and CSV file validation.</p>
		<p>If an implementation performs validation of a CSV file against a CSV Schema, a report SHOULD be produced for each <a>Column Validation Expression</a> 
		that fails validation;  This is generally considered a <a>Validation Error</a>, 
		unless the <a>Warning Directive</a> has been used to reduce the severity of an error within a specific  <a title="Column Rules">Column Rule</a> to a <a>Validation Warning</a>.
		</p>
		<section>
			<h2>Schema Errors</h2>
			<p>
			A <dfn>Schema Error</dfn> is caused by syntax errors in the definition of the CSV Schema.  These might include for example: an incorrect <a>Version Declaration</a>, or a mismatch between the 
			number specified for <a>Total Columns Directive</a> and the actual number of <a title="Column Definition">Column Definitions</a> given in the <a>Body</a> of the Schema. 
			Schema Errors would also be produced by mismatched <a title="Parenthesized Expression">Parenthesized Expressions</a>, 
			unrecognised <a title="Column Validation Expression">Column Validation Expressions</a> and <a title="Explicit Context Expression">Explicit Context Expressions</a> which do not 
			match an actual <a>Column Identifier</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			An implementation MUST report a Schema Error.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Validation Errors</h2>
			<p>
			If column data does not validate successfully against a <a title="Column Rules">Column Rule</a>, an implementation SHOULD report a <dfn>Validation Error</dfn>. 
			It is implementation defined whether a Validation Error terminates execution, or whether execution continues. If execution continues, any further errors SHOULD be reported.</p> 
			<p><strong>NOTE</strong> The <a>Warning Directive</a> may be used within a Column Rule to specify that what would normally be a Validation Error should be 
			treated only as a <a>Validation Warning</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			A <dfn>Validation Warning</dfn> can be used when you wish to highlight unexpected values that are encountered in the data, but for some reason they are not to be considered 
			failures of validation.  For example within archival documents the date may have been recorded as an <em>impossible</em> date, such as 30 February or 31 April.  A transcriber has correctly 
			entered the data as seen on the original document, but yet it is not a valid date. You may wish to highlight these cases for additional QA, but it should not be considered an error.

		<h2>The text/csv-schema Media Type</h2>
		<p>This Appendix specifies the media type for CSV Schema Language Version 1.0, CSV Schema Language Version 1.1, and CSV Schema Language Version 1.2. CSV Schema Language is a language for describing and validating CSV files, as specified in the main body of this document. This media type has been submitted to the IESG (Internet Engineering Steering Group) for review, approval, and registration with IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.)</p>
		<p>The <code>text/csv-schema</code> media type, is intended to be used for transmitting schemas written in the CSV Schema Language.</p>

		<h2>CSV Schema Grammar</h2>
		<section id="ebnf">
			<h3>EBNF</h3>
			<p>The grammar of CSV Schema uses the same simple <abbr>EBNF</abbr> (Extended Backus-Naur Form) notation as [[!XML10]] with the following minor differences.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>All named symbols have a name that begins with an uppercase letter.</li>
				<li>Comments or extra-grammatical constraints on grammar productions are between <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> symbols.</li>
				<li>A <code>xgc:</code> prefix is an extra-grammatical constraint, the details of which are explained in <a href="#xgc"></a></li>
				<li>The terminal symbols for this grammar include the quoted strings used in the production rules below, and the terminal symbols defined in section <a href="#lexical"></a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To increase readability, the EBNF in the main body of this document omits some of these notational features. This appendix is the normative version of the EBNF.</p>
			<p>Link conventions used in this appendix:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>links on the <em>left</em> of an expression go to more detailed discussion of the term in the body of this document</li>
				<li>links on the <em>right</em> of an expresson go to a further definition within this appendix.</li>
