      This document represents the specification of the CSV Schema 1.0 language
      as defined by <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk">The National Archives</a>.
      It is unclear yet whether this document will be submitted to a formal standards body
      such as the <a href="http://w3.org">W3C</a>.
    </section> 
    <section id='abstract'>
      <acronym title="Comma Separated Value">CSV</acronym> data comes in many shapes and sizes. Apart from [[RFC4180]] which is fairly recent and frequently ignored
      there is a lack of formal definition as to CSV data formats and in many ways this is one of its strengths.
      However, extracting structured information from CSV data for further processing or storage
      can prove difficult if the CSV data is not well understood or perhaps not even uniform. CSV Schema
      defines a textual language which can be used to define the data structure, types and rules for
      particular CSV data.

            The intention of this document is twofold:
            <ol>
                <li>To be informative to users who are writing CSV Schemas, and provide a reference to the available syntax and functions.</li>
                <li>To provide enough detail such that anyone with sufficient technical expertise should be able to implement a CSV Schema parser and/or CSV validator following the rules defined in a CSV Schema.</li>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                The National Archives Digital Repository Infrastructure system archives digitised and born-digital materials provided by <acronym title="Other Governmental Department">OGD</acronym>s
                and occasionally <acronym title="Non Governmental Organisation">NGO</acronym>s. For the purposes of Digital Preservation the system processes and archives large amounts of metadata, much
                of this metadata is created by the supplying organisation or by transcription. The metadata is further processed, and ultimately stored both online in an
                <acronym title="Resource Description Format">RDF</acronym> Triplestore and a majority subset archived in a non-RDF <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> format.
                However it was recognised that the creation of XML or RDF metadata by the supplier
                was most likely unrealistic for either technical or financial reasons. As such, CSV was recognised as a simple data format that is human readable (to a degree), that almost anyone could create
                simply; effectively CSV is the lowest common denominator in structured data formats.
            </p>
            <p>
                The National Archives have strict rules about various CSV file formats that they expect, and how the data in those file formats should be set out. To ensure the quality of their archival metadata
                it was recognised that CSV files would have to be validated, as such a general schema language for CSV was developed alongside a validation tool.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="principles">
            <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
            <p>The design of the CSV Schema language has been influenced by a few guiding principles, understanding these will help you to understand how and why it is structured the way that it is.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <div class="principle">Simplicity</div>
                    <p>The language should be expressible in plain text and should be simple enough that archival domain experts could easily write it without having to know a programming language or data/document modelling language such as XML or RDF.</p>
                    <p><strong>Note</strong>, the CSV Schema Language is NOT itself expressed in CSV, it is expressed in a simple text format.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="principle">Context is King!</div>
                    <p>Schema rules are written for each column of the CSV file. Each set of column rules are asserted against each row of the CSV file. Each rule in the CSV Schema operates on the current context (e.g. defined Column and parsed Row), unless otherwise specified. This makes the rules short and concise.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="principle">Stream Processing</div>
                    <p>Metadata files may be very large as such the CSV Schema Language was designed with concern for implementation of a validation tool which could read and process CSV data as a stream. Few operations require mnenomization of data from the CSV file, and where they do this is limited and should be optimisable to keep memory use to a minimum.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="principle">Sane Defaults</div>
                    <p>We try to do the right thing by default. CSV files and their brethren (Tab Separated Values etc.) can come in many shapes and sizes, by default we assume the CSV data format will comply with [[RFC4180]], of course we allow you to customize this behaviour in the CSV Schema.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="principle">Not a Programming Language.</div>
                    <p>This is worth stressing as it was something we had to keep sight of ourselves during development; CSV Schema is a simple data definition and validation language for CSV!</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

    <section id="basics" class="informative">
        <h1>Basics</h1>
        <p>
            A CSV Schema is really a rules based language which defines how data in each cell should be formatted.
            Rules are expressed per-column of the CSV data. Rules are evaluated for each row in the CSV data.
            A column rule may express constraints based on the content of other columns, however at present there is no scope for looking forward or backward through rows directly.
			However, it possible to check that a cell entry is unique within that column in the CSV file (or that the value of a combination of cells is unique)
        </p>
        <p>
            A CSV Schema is made up of two main parts:
			<ol class="nested">
				<li class="nested"><span class="point"><a>Prolog</a></span>
				<p>In turn this comprises (at most) two sections (the second being OPTIONAL):</p>
				<ol class="nested">
					<li class="nested">
						<span class="point"><a>Version Declaration</a></span>
						<p>The CSV Schema MUST explicitly state (as its first non-comment line) the version of the CSV Schema language that it uses. This is to allow for future evolution of the CSV Schema language to be easily handled by CSV Schema processors.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="nested">
						<span class="point"><a>Global Directives</a></span>
						<p>Global Directives apply to all processing of the CSV data. Global Directives for example allow you to define the separator sequence between columns in the CSV data. Global Directives appear before Column Rules and are prefixed with an <code>@</code> character.</p>
						<p>The use of Global Directives is OPTIONAL, default values are used if they are not specified.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li class="nested">
					<span class="point"><a>Body</a></span>
					<p>The Body of the CSV Schema MUST declare, in order, a <a>Column Rule</a> for each Column in the CSV data. If validation of a Column is not desirable, then an empty rule is used.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's now illustrate a simple CSV Schema that is concerned with CSV data about names, ages and gender:
            <pre class="example" title="Simple CSV Schema">
version 1.0

@totalColumns 3

name: notEmpty
age: range(0, 120)
gender: is("m") or is("f") or is("t") or is("n") 
            </pre>
            This CSV Schema basically defines that the CSV data must have 3 columns: the first
            column, <em>name</em>, must have some sort of value; the second column, <em>age</em>,
            must be a number between 0 and 120 inclusive; and the third column, <em>gender</em>,
            must be one of the characters m, f, t or n. An example of CSV data that would match the
            rule definitions in the CSV schema could be as follows:
            <pre class="example" title="Valid CSV Data">
name,age,gender
james,21,m
lauren,19,f
simon,57,m
            </pre>
            An example of CSV data would fail the rule definitions in the CSV schema could be
            as follows:
            <pre class="example" title="Invalid CSV Data">
name,age,gender
james,4 years,m
lauren,19,f
simon,57,male
            </pre>
            The Invalid CSV Data example above fails when validated against the CSV Schema because: 1) at row 2 column 2, "4 years" is not a number between 1 and 120 inclusive, and 2) at row 4 column 3, "male" is not one of the characters m, f, t, or n.
        </p>

		<h1>Schema structure</h1>
		<p>
		The CSV schema language is formally a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar">context-free grammar</a>
		expressed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBNF"><dfn title="EBNF">Extended Backhaus-Naur Form</dfn></a>  (EBNF - see also [[RFC5234]])
		</p>
		<p>
		The following subsections examine the structure of a CSV Schema in more detail. 
		Each subsection comprises definitions of terms, cross-references to other definitions, 
		the relevant portion of the <a>EBNF</a> (along with links to the appendix containing the full EBNF),
		and examples of correct usage.
		</p>
		<section>
			<h2>Prolog</h2>
			<p>The <dfn>prolog</dfn> of a CSV Schema MUST contain the <a>Version Declaration</a> and MAY contain one or more <a>Global Directives</a>.</p>
			<table class="ebnf-table">

					<td class="ebnf-num">[2]</td>

			</table>
			<section>
				<h3>Version Declaration</h3>
				<p>
				The <dfn>Version Declaration</dfn> declares explicitly which version of the CSV Schema language is in use. 
				At present this MUST be fixed to <code>version 1.0</code>. 
				If the version is not valid this is considered a <a>Schema Error</a>. 
				The Version Declaration is MANDATORY.

				<h3>Global Directives</h3>
				<p>
				The <dfn>Global Directives</dfn> allow you to modify the overall processing of a CSV file or how subsequent <a>Column Rules</a> are evaluated. 
				The use of Global Directives within a CSV Schema is OPTIONAL.
				The last two Global Directives described (<a>No Header Directive</a> and <a>Ignore Column Name Case Directive</a>) are mutually exclusive, 
				they MUST NOT both be used in a single schema. 
				There is no inherent reason why the Global Directives should be in the order shown, <a>EBNF</a> does not directly cater for unordered lists.
				You could explicitly list each possible ordering, but that would require 4!=24 orderings to be included in the ENBF.
				All directives (both Global Directives and <a>Column Directives</a>) used in the CSV Schema are indicated by the <dfn>Directive Prefix</dfn>, 
				defined as the character <code>@</code> i.e. the UTF-8 character code <code>0x40</code>.

					</tr>
				</table>
				<section>
					<h4>Separator Directive</h4>
					<p>The <dfn>Separator Directive</dfn> allows you to specify the separator character that is used between columns in the CSV data. 
					As with all <a>Global Directives</a> the Separator Directive is OPTIONAL, if not supplied the default value is assumed.
					By default the separator is a <code>comma</code> i.e. the UTF-8 character code <code>0x2c</code> (as specified in [[RFC4180]]).
					</p>
					<p>
					The Separator Directive takes a MANDATORY parameter in the form of either a <dfn>TAB Expression</dfn> or a <dfn>Separator Character</dfn>.
					</p>
					<p>
					A <a>TAB Expression</a> indicates that the separator comprises one (or more) <code>spaces</code> i.e. the UTF-8 character code <code>0x20</code>. 
					It takes an OPTIONAL parameter of an <dfn>Integer Literal</dfn>: any positive, non-zero, integer value.
					If no value is supplied, the default of four spaces is assumed, but any other positive number can be specified as an integer input to the parameter.
					<!--In fact currently any integer value would be accepted, even 0 or -ve values, this has been raised as an issue-->
					</p>
					<p>
					A <a>Separator Character</a> is a <a>Character Literal</a>: the character which is to be treated as the column separator.
					</p>
					<!-- following two paras probably logically fit lower down, as the ReSpec crossreferences will allow people to go directly to them-->
					<p>
					A <dfn>Character Literal</dfn> is a single <a>Non-breaking Character</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
					<dfn>Non-breaking Character</dfn>: Unicode characters not including those represented in regex by <code>\n</code> or <code>\r</code><!--Unicode equivalents??-->.
					</p>

					<h4>Quoted Directive</h4>
					<p>The <dfn>Quoted Directive</dfn> allows you to specify whether or not all columns are quoted.</p>
					<table class="ebnf-table">

							<td class="ebnf-left"><a title="ebnf-quoted-directive"><dfn>QuotedDirective</dfn></a></td>

						</tr>     
					</table>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Total Columns Directive</h4>
					<p>
					The <dfn>Total Columns Directive</dfn> allows you to specify the total number of data columns expected to make up each row of the CSV file.
					The parser will also verify that the <a>Body</a> of the CSV Schema contains the same number of <a title="Column Rule">Column Rules</a>,
					a mismatch is considered a <a>Schema Error</a>.
					The Total Columns Directive is OPTIONAL: when this directive is not used this verification of the number of column rules cannot be performed,
					and it will be assumed that you have supplied the correct number of Column Rules.
					</p>
<!--					TotalColumnsDirective       ::=     DirectivePrefix "totalColumns" PositiveNonZeroIntegerLiteral-->
					<table class="ebnf-table">

						</tr>     
					</table>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>No Header Directive</h4>
					<p>
					The <dfn>No Header Directive</dfn> is used to indicate that the CSV file to be validated does not contain a header row: i.e. all rows are data rows.
					The No Header Directive is OPTIONAL: when this directive is not used the parser assumes the default that the first row of the CSV file to be validated contains column names,
					not data, and so the first row is skipped during validation.
					</p>
					<p>
					NB Even when this directive is not specified, the parser is not required to match the column names present in the CSV file against the column names used to
					specify the <a title="Column Rule">Column Rules</a> in the <a>Body</a> of the CSV Schema.
					</p>
					<p>
					The No Header Directive is mutually exclusive to the use of the <a>Ignore Column Name Case Directive</a>, when one is used, the other MUST NOT be.
					</p>
					<table class="ebnf-table">
						<tr>
							<td class="ebnf-num">[11]</td>
							<td class="ebnf-left"><a title="ebnf-no-header-directive"><dfn>NoHeaderDirective</dfn></a></td>
